                <h3>Oil</h3>
                <p>
                    Oil is the lifeblood of your car. Regularly changing your car’s oil is the most important
                    routine maintenance you can do. Clean oil prolongs the life of your engine, reduces wear
                    and tear of its critical moving parts and keeps your car functioning properly. Keep your
                    car in top shape for longer at Northcliff Auto.

                <h3>Batteries</h3>
                <p>
                    Your car’s battery is essential to its life, a properly functioning battery leads to less
                    heat exhaustion from the engine ensuring the car doesn’t overheat and keeps performing at
                    peak levels. At Northcliff Auto we have a range of high-powered batteries known for their
                    higher starting power, reliable power supply and longer service life.

                <h3>Wipers</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the most critical car parts is its windscreen wiper, it needs to wipe water away quickly and efficiently. Wiper blades are a part that seldom gets attention but a heavy rainstorm will quickly remind you of its importance. At Northcliff Auto our high-performance wiper blades are specifically designed for optimum visibility in even the most severe weather conditions.
